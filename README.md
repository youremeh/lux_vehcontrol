# lux_vehcontrol

An updated **lux_vehcontrol** with improved code and keybinds.
Original can be found and downloaded [here](https://forum.cfx.re/t/release-luxart-vehicle-control/17304).

## What's changed?
```
- Better code optimization
- Added a "light reminder" using "/lr"
- Ability to change any of the keybinds to your liking using ox_lib
- If the sirens are on, getting out of the vehicle dirver seat will disable them automatically
- Disables distant siren sounds, fixes multiple issues
- Starts different "blank" audios to prevent/stop ghost sirens (same with above)

- Uses new native "OverrideReactionToVehicleSiren" to move locals out the way
(see this: https://docs.fivem.net/natives/?_0x3F3EB3F7 for more info)
